# Salary-Predictor

## Using Simple Linear Regression:

This project implements a machine learning model that predicts an employee’s salary based on their years of experience using Simple Linear Regression.

## Components:

**model.ipynb**

This Jupyter Notebook contains the full workflow — including data preprocessing, training the Simple Linear Regression model, evaluation, and model serialization.

**model.pkb**

A serialized version of the trained model saved using Python’s pickle library. This can be loaded directly for making predictions without retraining the model.

## Dataset:

**Salary_Data.csv**

YearsExperience: Work experience of an employee in years.

Salary: Salary of an employee based on work experience.

## Outcome:

A lightweight and efficient regression model capable of accurately predicting salaries based on experience, suitable for use in HR analytics tools or candidate screening systems.
